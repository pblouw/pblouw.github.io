I work as a technical advisor at [Global Affairs
Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/global-affairs-affaires-mondiales/home-accueil.aspx?lang=eng).
Previously, I worked as a research  scientist and advanced projects lead at [Applied Brain Research](https://www.appliedbrainresearch.com), an AI company that spun out of the University of Waterloo. Before joining ABR, I did my PhD in the [Philosophy Department](http://www.uwaterloo.ca/philosophy/) and the [Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca) at Waterloo.
