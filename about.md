I recently finished my PhD in the [Philosophy Department](http://www.uwaterloo.ca/philosophy/) and the [Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca) at the University of Waterloo. Right now, I work mostly on topics related to cognitive science and natural language processing. You can find out more about my current and past work by looking through the papers posted on this site.
