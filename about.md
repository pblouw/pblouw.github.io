I work as a research scientist and advanced projects lead at [Applied Brain Research](https://www.appliedbrainresearch.com), an AI company that spun out of the University of Waterloo. Before joining ABR, I did my PhD in the [Philosophy Department](http://www.uwaterloo.ca/philosophy/) and the [Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca) at Waterloo. I mostly focus on topics related to speech processing, language processing, planning, and reasoning.
